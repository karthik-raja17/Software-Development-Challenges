# SoftDev Challenges - Solutions Repository

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to a series of shell scripting and system administration challenges focused on text processing, log analysis, automation, and file system management using Unix command-line tools.

## Challenges Completed

### 1. CSV Field Separator Conversion
**Problem**: Convert a CSV file with quoted fields containing commas to pipe-delimited format while preserving the structure.

**Key Concepts**:
- Handling quoted fields with embedded delimiters
- Text stream processing
- Field separator conversion

### 2. Dynamic Makefile for Monthly Builds
**Problem**: Create a Makefile that automatically builds an application with different C files each month based on the current month.

**Key Concepts**:
- Makefile automation
- Dynamic target generation
- Date-based file selection
- Dependency management

### 3. CommandLineFu HTML Parser
**Problem**: Parse HTML from CommandLineFu.com to extract and display only commands with 5 or more votes.

**Key Concepts**:
- HTML parsing with command-line tools
- Text extraction and filtering
- Regular expressions in shell
- Vote threshold filtering

### 4. SSH Brute Force Detection
**Problem**: Analyze authentication logs to identify IP addresses with more failed than successful login attempts, but at least one success.

**Key Concepts**:
- Log file analysis
- Pattern matching with grep/awk
- Statistical analysis of login attempts
- Security monitoring

### 5. Network Connection Geolocation
**Problem**: Filter network connections by timestamp and subnet, then resolve IP addresses to countries for incident investigation.

**Key Concepts**:
- Log filtering by time and network range
- IP geolocation lookup
- Text processing with geoiplookup
- Connection analysis

### 6. Automated Directory Compression
**Problem**: Compress directories that don't contain any files accessed in the last month to save disk space.

**Key Concepts**:
- File system traversal
- Access time (atime) checking
- Conditional directory compression with tar
- Recursive directory processing

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Shell Scripting**: Bash, sh, and command-line utilities
- **Text Processing**: sed, awk, grep, cut, tr, and other Unix filters
- **System Administration**: Log analysis, file system management, process automation
- **Makefile Development**: Build automation and dependency management
- **Regular Expressions**: Pattern matching for text extraction and transformation
- **Data Analysis**: Log parsing, statistical calculations, and reporting

## Usage
Each challenge solution is self-contained. To test any solution:

1. Navigate to the specific challenge directory
2. Follow the individual instructions in each solution file
3. Test with provided or sample input files

## Prerequisites
- Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, WSL)
- Standard Unix utilities (grep, sed, awk, find, tar, etc.)
- `geoiplookup` for Challenge 5 (install with `geoip-bin` package)
- `gcc` for Challenge 2 Makefile testing

## Notes
- All solutions use only command-line tools and shell scripting (no Python/Perl unless specified)
- Solutions are designed to work with pipes and standard input/output
- Each solution includes error handling appropriate for the task
- Code follows Unix philosophy of small, composable tools

## Author
Solutions completed as part of the SoftDev challenges server assignments, focusing on practical system administration and automation skills.
