# 🛠️ SoftDev Challenges - Solutions Repository

## 📝 Overview
This repository contains solutions to a series of shell scripting and system administration challenges focused on text processing, log analysis, automation, and file system management using Unix command-line tools.

## 🚀 Challenges Completed

### 1. CSV Field Separator Conversion
* **Problem**: Convert a CSV file with quoted fields containing commas to pipe-delimited format while preserving the structure.
* **Key Concepts**: Handling quoted fields, text stream processing, and field separator conversion.

### 2. Dynamic Makefile for Monthly Builds
* **Problem**: Create a Makefile that automatically builds an application with different C files each month based on the current system date.
* **Key Concepts**: Makefile automation, dynamic target generation, and dependency management.

### 3. CommandLineFu HTML Parser
* **Problem**: Parse HTML from CommandLineFu.com to extract and display only commands with 5 or more votes.
* **Key Concepts**: HTML parsing with CLI tools, regex-based filtering, and text extraction.

### 4. SSH Brute Force Detection
* **Problem**: Analyze authentication logs to identify IP addresses with more failed than successful login attempts, but at least one success.
* **Key Concepts**: Log file analysis, pattern matching with `awk`/`grep`, and security monitoring.

### 5. Network Connection Geolocation
* **Problem**: Filter network connections by timestamp and subnet, then resolve IP addresses to countries for incident investigation.
* **Key Concepts**: Subnet filtering, IP geolocation lookup, and `geoiplookup` integration.

### 6. Automated Directory Compression
* **Problem**: Compress directories that don't contain any files accessed in the last month to save disk space.
* **Key Concepts**: File system traversal, access time (`atime`) checking, and recursive processing with `tar`.
