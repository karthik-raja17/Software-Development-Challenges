Welcome to the SoftDev challenges server!
Please, read this file VERY carefully

Rules of the system:

1. In your home you find a directory called "challenges"
   Inside, you have one subdirectory for each assignment.
   However, at the beginning you will not have the permissions
   to access all of them. Certain challenges will be open only
   after you correctly solve the other ones.

2. You can check the game progress using the "game" command.
   Just run "game" without paramenters to get a short description
   of how to use it.

3. You can submit a solution for a challenge by using the
   "submit" command. Just run "submit" without parameters to 
   get a short description of how to use it.

4. Everything you do and everything you store in this machine 
   can and will be monitored. If you abuse the system or if you start 
   using this server for weird stuff, your account
   will be suspended and you will fail the homework (and the class)

5. If you find a bug in the system, report it to me as soon as
   possible. Do NOT take advantage of it.
   If you intentially cause a DOS or bother other users you 
   will face my anger.

6. Cheating is forbidden. Hacking the system is forbidden 
   as well (this is not a security class).
   Copying the solution from other students is even more forbidden.

7. Nothing else. I just wanted to have seven rules

Now go, play, have fun, and try to learn something along the way.
